h1. TabMenu

TabMenu is an easy way to create tabs for your Rails Application.

h2. Examples

<pre>
<%- tab_menu "user_menu" do |t| -%>
  <%= t.tab "Profile", "/account"
  <%= t.tab "Change Settings", "/account/edit" %>
<%- end -%>
</pre>

h2. This will render:

<pre>
<ul class="user_menu">
  <li class="active"><a href="/account">Profile</a></li>
  <li><a href="/account/edit">Change Settings</li>
</ul>
</pre>

note the active class is designated for the current url and that url helpers are allowed in the second argument

h2. TODO

* Eliminate concat calls once double redirect defects are fixed in Rails 2.2
** see http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/386-nested-content_tag-calls-causes-the-layout-to-render-multiple-times
* Abstract TabBuilder to support AJAX loading of tabs (different types of builders)
* Submenus
